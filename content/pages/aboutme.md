Washington, DC -- For most people it is just a place where you go on a 6th grade field trip to look at monuments and museums. For me it’s home. A city filled with architecture, stunning parks, and a whole bunch of creatives, including me, Delaney. I live in the Union Market District with my boyfriend Nick, and our Aussiedoodle pup, Captain! On days off you’ll find us exploring the DMV while I snap as many pictures as possible. Most nights, Nick and I are grabbing a bite at a restaurant in our neighborhood, and coming home to enjoy one of the many products of my baking obsession.

I am currently the Project and Procurement Manager for Shannon Claire Interiors and learning everything there is to know about interior and digital design. I am also managing Anna Kemper Atelier, a new brick-and-mortar home store here in DC, while enhancing the company's social media, ecommerce platforms, and store operations. I collaborate often with other photographers and local brands on any and all projects, specializing in prop styling.

I studied Business Management at Manhattan College, and while studying in NYC my creativity flourished. After a couple years of innovation, sewing and sketching, I honed in my creativity on fashion and entered the world of retail. In three and a half years I had held management positions in both the Home and Apparel Departments at Anthropologie, gaining knowledge of the industry and becoming a style maven.

My dream job is to be a full time Stylist and everything that title encommases. In an age where most marketing and sales happen online especially through social media, there is such a power that comes with a styling position for a company or individual. One of my strengths is working on teams and collaborating. I know I can take direction, while bringing my own imagination, to create the perfect setting and mood for each project. I have a strong attention to detail and know exactly how to emphasize the best parts of every product or setting.
