  title: About Me
---

I live with my boyfriend and our one year old Aussiedoodle pup, Captain, in Washington, DC. On my days off you’ll find Cap and me strolling around the National Arboretum while I snap pictures. Even though I'm addicted to fashion, my second love is nature. I am a trained beekeeper and am amazed by the structure of the hive and the bee’s work ethics.  Most nights, Nick and I are grabbing a bite at one of the amazing restaurants in our neighborhood, and coming home to enjoy one of the many products of my baking obsession.

I am currently  running the Omni operations for the downtown DC Anthropologie. I collaborate often with photographers, make-up artists, and local brands on any and all projects. I've shadowed one of the top photographers in DC—learning the ins-and-outs of all the details behind a photo shoot.

I studied Business Management at Manhattan College, and while living in NYC my personal style flourished. After moving back to Connecticut after school I started in retail to gain knowledge of the industry. I started full-time at Brooks Brothers doing remote styling, then accepted my first management position at anthropologie soon after.

My dream job is to be an ecommerce stylist for a fashion brand. The way a garment looks on the model and how it is styled directly affects the sales. In an age where most shopping happens online, there is such a power that comes with a position styling pieces for websites and social media. One of my strengths is working on teams and collaborating. I know I can take direction, while bringing my own imagination, and create the perfect setting and mood for each garment. I have a strong attention to details and know exactly how to emphasize the best parts of every piece of clothing.
